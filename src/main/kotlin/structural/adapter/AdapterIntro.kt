/**
 * Imagine yourself in a hotel room late in the evening, with 7% battery left on your phone.
 * Your phone charger was left in the office at the other end of the city.
 * You only have an EU plug charger with a Mini USB cable.
 * But your phone uses USB-C, as you had to upgrade.
 * You're in New York, so all of your outlets are (of course) USB-A.
 *
 * So, what do you do? Oh, it's easy.
 *
 * You look for a Mini USB to USB-C adapter in the middle of the night
 * And hope that you have remembered to bring your EU to US plug adapter as well.
 * Only 5% battery left â€“ time is running out!
