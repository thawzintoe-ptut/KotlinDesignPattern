# ðŸš§ Kotlin Design Patterns Examples [WIP] ðŸš§

Welcome to the Kotlin Design Patterns Examples repository! This project aims to provide clear and concise examples of how to implement various design patterns in Kotlin. Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to refresh your design pattern knowledge or a newcomer eager to learn, you'll find this repository useful.

## Introduction

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code. They are essential for writing robust and maintainable software.

In this repository, we explore how these patterns can be applied in Kotlin, a modern, concise, and safe programming language that's interoperable with Java and supports functional programming features.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Kotlin set up on your machine. The easiest way to work with Kotlin is to use IntelliJ IDEA, but you're free to use any IDE or text editor of your choice.

### Prerequisites

- JDK 1.8 or later
- IntelliJ IDEA Community/Ultimate Edition or any preferred IDE with Kotlin support

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine to get started:

## Patterns Covered

This repository is structured to cover various design patterns under the following categories:

### Creational Patterns: Simplify object creation in complex scenarios.
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Factory Method
- Prototype
- Singleton

### Structural Patterns: Deal with object composition or structure.
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

### Behavioral Patterns: Handle efficient communication and responsibility delegation between objects.
- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

Each pattern is contained in its own package with a comprehensive example and a `README.md` file explaining the pattern's intent, applicability, pros/cons, and how the example implements the pattern.

## Usage

To run an example, navigate to the corresponding package in your IDE and execute the main method of the example class. Each example is designed to be standalone and illustrate the pattern in an understandable context.
